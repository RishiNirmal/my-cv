            <p>
            I have 4 years working in front-end development as well as 2 years working back-end. I am very confident in my abilities to produce the best quality of work. Most of my experience stems from doing freelance work for start-up companies, during these 5 years I have learned a variety of transferrable skills
that I can apply to any project and adapt to any team environment.

            <p>
            Extremely passionate about time management, development, processes, documenting, and bringing out the best in every team that I am a part of. I have good communication skills, work well in a team, and equally well on my own. I am self-motivated, always looking to push my skills further and learn new technology.
